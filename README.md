# DungeonPixel

## Intro
 Problem: No good free procedural dungeons generator.
 
 Solution: write my own so I can play minecraft dungeon crawlers anytime

## (planned) Features
  - Data driven procedural dungeon generator: just drop in your worldedit schematics and watch them generate your own custom dungeon!
  - Particle Toolkit: makes using paper particlebuilder slightly easier
  - Custom Items & mobs from json: TODO

## Checklist
  - literally empty, nothing is playable rn except stick makes funny particle beam
